Web Outage Incident Postmortem
Incident Date: June 1, 2024
Duration: 2 hours (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM UTC)
Impact: 50% of users experienced service disruptions, including slow loading times and intermittent access failures.
Root Cause: The root cause was a misconfigured load balancer, which led to an uneven distribution of traffic and overwhelmed a subset of our web servers.
Issue Summary
On June 1, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM UTC, our primary web service experienced significant performance degradation, affecting approximately 50% of our user base. Users reported slow page loads and intermittent service outages.
Timeline
9:55 AM UTC: Monitoring system detected increased error rates and latency.
10:00 AM UTC: Initial alerts triggered, indicating potential issues with web service performance.
10:05 AM UTC: Engineering team began investigation; suspected database performance issues.
10:15 AM UTC: Database team checked resource usage and confirmed normal operations.
10:30 AM UTC: Frontend team investigated application server logs; no anomalies found.
10:45 AM UTC: Network team escalated issue after noticing irregular traffic patterns.
11:00 AM UTC: Identified misconfigured load balancer settings as the potential cause.
11:15 AM UTC: Adjusted load balancer configuration to redistribute traffic evenly.
11:30 AM UTC: Service performance began to stabilize.
12:00 PM UTC: Incident resolved; monitoring for any residual issues.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The incident was caused by a recent update to the load balancer configuration that inadvertently set incorrect traffic distribution parameters. This misconfiguration caused a disproportionate amount of traffic to be directed to a subset of web servers, leading to resource exhaustion on those servers while others remained underutilized.
Resolution: The load balancer configuration was reviewed and corrected to ensure even traffic distribution across all web servers. Following the adjustment, traffic patterns normalized, and the affected servers recovered, restoring normal service performance.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance load balancer configuration management processes.
Implement additional monitoring and alerting for load balancer traffic distribution.
Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings post-update.
Tasks:
Review Load Balancer Configurations: Conduct a comprehensive review of current load balancer settings to identify and correct any potential misconfigurations.
Implement Monitoring: Develop and deploy monitoring tools to track load balancer performance and traffic distribution in real-time.
Establish Update Protocols: Create a standardized protocol for load balancer updates, including peer review and automated testing.
Training: Provide additional training for network and operations teams on load balancer configuration and management.
Post-Incident Review: Schedule a post-incident review meeting to discuss the incident, its causes, and preventative measures with all relevant teams.
By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve the overall resilience of our web services.
